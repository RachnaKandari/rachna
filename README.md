This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset. The aim is to identify insights about various movie attributes such as budget, gross earnings, scores, and other relevant information that can help understand patterns and correlations within the data.

**Project Overview**

The analysis includes:

-Data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and checking data types.
-Statistical and visual analysis using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
-Explorations of relationships between features, such as gross earnings, budget, and score.

The following libraries are used in this project:
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn

**Key Insights**
-Data Distribution: Box plots are used to examine outliers in the dataset, especially for gross earnings.
-Correlations: Scatter plots and regression analyses explore relationships between gross and budget, as well as score and gross.
-Data Cleaning: The notebook includes steps to handle missing data and ensure data consistency.
